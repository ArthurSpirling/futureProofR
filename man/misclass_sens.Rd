\usage{
misclass_sens(
  dat,
  outcome,
  treatment,
  binary,
  nsims = 30,
  tol = 0.01,
  max_iter = 1000,
  m,
  R_vect = seq(0.01, 0.5, by = 0.01)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Data frame containing the data.}

\item{outcome}{Character. Name of the outcome variable.}

\item{treatment}{Character. Name of the treatment variable.}

\item{binary}{Character. Name of the binary variable subject to misclassification.}

\item{nsims}{Integer. Number of simulations to run.}

\item{tol}{Numeric. Tolerance for reclassification rate.}

\item{max_iter}{Integer. Maximum iterations for joint restrictions.}

\item{m}{Model object. The fitted regression model.}

\item{R_vect}{Numeric vector. Proportions of observations to reclassify.}
}
\value{
A list containing bounds and simulation results.
}
\description{
This function performs sensitivity analysis by simulating misclassification
in a binary variable and estimating bounds on regression coefficients.
